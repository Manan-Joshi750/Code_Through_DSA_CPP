/*The Bellman-Ford Algorithm is a single-source shortest path algorithm for graphs with both positive and negative edge weights. 
Unlike Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, Bellman-Ford can handle graphs with negative weights and is often used to detect negative weight cycles.

Key Points of the Bellman-Ford Algorithm:
--> Initialization:
Set the distance to the source node as 0 and all other nodes to infinity (INT_MAX).
--> Relax All Edges Repeatedly:
For each edge (u, v), if the distance to v through u is shorter than the current known distance to v, update it.
This process is repeated exactly (V-1) times, where V is the number of vertices. After these repetitions, the shortest paths (if they exist) will be found.
--> Check for Negative Weight Cycles:
To detect negative weight cycles, go through all edges one more time. If we find a shorter path to any vertex during this step, 
it means there is a negative weight cycle in the graph. */
