# My DSA Journey 🚀

## Overview
Welcome to my **DSA Journey** repository! 🎉 This repository is a reflection of my consistent hard work, dedication, and passion for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Between **July 5, 2024**, and **December 31, 2024**, I committed myself to an intensive journey of learning and problem-solving based on **Love Babbar's 149 DSA videos** in C++.

While this marks a significant milestone in my DSA journey, I believe that DSA is an ever-evolving field where true mastery comes from continuous learning and practice. It’s all about understanding the key aspects of each data structure and algorithm, along with their real-world applications. I am not a master yet, but I am fully committed to staying on this path and striving to improve. Who knows? I wouldn’t mind becoming a master someday! 😉

Throughout this journey, I solved numerous problems, developed a deep understanding of core concepts, and applied my knowledge extensively on platforms like **LeetCode** and **VS Code**.

## Topics Covered
This repository includes organized folders for various DSA topics. Here are the topics I covered in detail:

- **Sorting Techniques**: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- **Searching**: Binary Search, Linear Search, and advanced techniques.
- **Arrays**: Manipulation, optimization problems, and more.
- **Strings**: Pattern matching, permutations, and problem-solving.
- **Backtracking**: N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, and more.
- **Linked Lists**: Single, Double, Circular, and operations.
- **Pointers & Functions**: Deep dives and practical implementations.
- **OOPS Concepts**: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction and practical implementation.  
- **Recursion**: Fundamentals, optimizations, and real-world problems.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Knapsack, LCS, and beyond.
- **Trees & Graphs**: Traversals, MSTs, Shortest Paths, and advanced problems.
- **Heaps**: Min/Max heaps, priority queues.
- **Tries**: Prefix trees, auto-complete, and applications.
- **Hashing**: Hash maps, sets, and collision handling.
And many more...

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured topic-wise to help navigate easily. Each folder may have fewer codes compared to the problems I actually solved because a significant portion of my work is reflected in my **LeetCode Profile**.

## Highlights
- Solved numerous problems on **LeetCode**.
- Implemented solutions in **C++**.
- Worked on all foundational and advanced DSA concepts.
- Stayed consistent and dedicated throughout this journey.

## Why This Repository?
This repository is not just a collection of codes; it’s a testament to my perseverance, consistency, and learning journey. While some folders may seem less populated, rest assured, I have given my best effort to every topic. Most of the practice reflects my extensive problem-solving on LeetCode.
