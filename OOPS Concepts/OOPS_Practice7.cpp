/*Write a program simulating an ATM where the Customer class contains information
about the customerâ€™s account balance. Another class ATM has a function that accepts a
Customer object and performs operations like withdrawal and balance checking. The
ATM class should not allow a withdrawal if the customer has insufficient funds. Handle
the case where the customer tries to withdraw more than available balance and ensure
that the withdrawal process updates the balance correctly. */
